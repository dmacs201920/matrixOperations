This project is about simple matrix operations.


INPUT :Input to this project is given using a text file on commandline.(test.txt)(file)
     [Input in file shloud be given as below :
      In first row dimension of 1st matrix (row spaces coloum)(spaces) dimension of 2nd matrix (row spaces coloum).
      (eg.2 2 3 3)

      entries of matrix 1 then entries of matrix 2
      (eg.2 3   {entries of 1st matrix (row1)}
          3 4   {entries of 1st matrix (row2)}
          1 3 4 {entries of 2nd matrix (row1)}
          1 2 3 {entries of 2nd matrix (row2)}
          2 3 3 {entries of 2nd matrix (row3)}
       )
     ]
