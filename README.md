# matrixOperations
A novice implementation of matrix operations in C
                              OM SRI SAI RAM

This project is about simple matrix operations.

WORK DIVISION: K.SAIPRANEETH(function.c).
               N.S.S.KAMALESH(f.c).
               try.c(combined).
INPUT :Input to this project is given using a text file on commandline.(test.txt)(file)
     [Sample Input in file shloud be given as below :
      In first row dimension of 1st matrix (row space coloum space) dimension of 2nd matrix (row space coloum).
      (ex. 2 2 3 3)

      entries of matrix 1 then entries of matrix 2
      (ex. 2 3   {entries of 1st matrix (row1)}
           3 4   {entries of 1st matrix (row2)}
           1 3 4 {entries of 2nd matrix (row1)}
           1 2 3 {entries of 2nd matrix (row2)}
           2 3 3 {entries of 2nd matrix (row3)}
       )
     ]

     Input for system of linear equations.(1.txt)(file) (input is taken by function automatically)
     [Sample Input in file shloud be give as below :
       ex. +1.3x+3.4y+5.6z=-1.3
           +2.5x-2.0y-5.0z=+4.2
	   +0.0x+1.3y+1.1z=-1.4
	   +0.7x+4.0y+6.9z=-2.7
     ]

OUTPUT :as per user's requriment.(switch cases)
